## Technical Implementation

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Unified Marketplace**: Single contract handles all asset types for simplicity
2. **Escrow Pattern**: Assets locked in contract during listing for security
3. **Original Amount Tracking**: Added `originalAmount` field to properly handle partial fills
4. **Pull Payment**: Buyers lock funds when making offers

### Gas Optimization
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal external calls
- Batch operations ready for future implementation
